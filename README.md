Paper: Resource Optimization for Tail-Based Control in Wireless Networked Control Systems

Link to DOI: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10817284

This paper explores the use of an alternative control concept defined as tail-based control, which extends the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) cost function for multiple dynamic control systems over a shared wireless network.
